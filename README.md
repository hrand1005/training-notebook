Monolithic webapp architecture. Uses go server with reactjs frontend.

# Setup

You need a SQLite driver in order to run this server with a database.
I recommend: 
```
go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3  
go install github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
```
You may also need to install or reinstall gcc. E.g. on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install --reinstall build-essential
```
