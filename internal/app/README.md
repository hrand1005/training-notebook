## app (name tbd)

This package defines the core entities / business objects. Ideally, all the core 
logic, services, models, stores etc. exist here. The one and only source of truth.
The revered, precious, pure code with no external dependencies. To be honest, I'm skeptical
about how well something so idealistic works in real world projects, but I'll keep this 
layer clean as long as possible. The effort may be wasted in functional terms, but I think it
will be educational.

Final name TBD -- I want to give it the same name as the repo once a good name
is decided.
